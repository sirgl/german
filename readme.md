# German knowledge base

Trying to learn German by constructing sentences formally and parsing them.

## Project goals

### Long term

1. Sentence parsing (extracting all parts of sentence)
2. Automatic suggestions of incomplete members (autocomplete)

### Short term

1. Parsing of simple sentence (Die Katze trinkt wasser)

## Restriction model

Everything is driven by restrictions:

1. Characteristics of words, e.g. gender
2. Ability to have article
3. Position in sentence
 
 
 Sentence construction == solving all the restrictions
 
 Restrictions work only for things between words in sentence

 Examples:
 
 Object must be in accusative because of transitive verb.
 
 Person of verb must be first because of personal pronoun (ich).
